# Advanced Excel Project: Road Accidents Analysis

Welcome to the Advanced Excel project repository! ðŸš— I'm excited to present a dynamic analysis of road accidents in a country over two years. Let's dive into the insights and visualizations derived from this comprehensive exploration.

## Project Overview

### Steps Covered

1. **Data Cleaning:** Ensured the dataset is pristine, eliminating errors for accurate analysis.
2. **Data Processing:** Added customized columns to enhance the dataset, providing deeper insights.
3. **Data Analysis:** Utilized Pivot Tables and Excel Functions to extract meaningful patterns.
4. **Data Visualization:** Crafted charts and custom sheets to visually represent critical findings.
5. **Interactive Report/Dashboard:** Developed an interactive report from inception to offer a holistic perspective.

## Key Insights

Here are some pivotal insights garnered through the analysis:

1. **Mortality Rate:** Shockingly, over 7000 lives were lost in road accidents during the two-year span.
2. **Vehicle Impact:** Car accidents contribute significantly to casualties.
3. **Urban Hotspots:** Accidents are more prevalent in urban areas, particularly on single-lane roads.
4. **Time of Day Influence:** Most accidents occur during daylight hours.
5. **Road Condition Paradox:** Surprisingly, dry roads are more accident-prone despite the perceived danger of wet or snowy conditions.

## How to Explore

1. **Review the Code:** Dive into the Excel sheets to examine the formulas and functions used for data analysis.
2. **Visualizations:** Explore visually appealing charts and custom sheets showcasing key trends.
3. **Interactive Dashboard:** Experience a comprehensive interactive report that provides a holistic view of the road accident data.
